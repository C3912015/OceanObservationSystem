<h1>OceanObservationSystem</h1>

<h2>Install</h2>
Once downloaded from eclass, place the zip folder into the location of your PHP server and unzip.<br>
When it has been unzipped, navigate into the folder titled code and open a terminal here. Run:<br><br>

<b>script.sh</b><br><br>

which will change the permissions of all the files in this folder.<br>

Once this is done, it can be accessed from a browser by going: <br><br>

<b> root/login.php </b> <br><br>

where root is the php servers url. From here you can login and navigate the different pages.

<h2>Login Module</h2>
The login module starts off by asking you to provide a <b>Username</b> and <b>Password.</b><br>
You must have been provided access by an Administrator, and know both of these pieces of information. If you don't know them, contact the Admin of the server.<br>
Once signed in, you are greeted by a page with specialized options based on your clearance. The three levels are:<br>
<h3>1.	Adminstrator</h3>
The Administrator can add new users and delete current users.
<h3>2.	Data Curators</h3> 
The data curator can upload sensor data including audio, images and scalar data.
<h3>3.	Scientist</h3>
The scientist can subscribe and unsubscribe from sensors and also do data analysis on sensors they are subscribed to.<br><br>
This login page is what allows you to navigate all these options. It also contains the page that allows any user to search, allows you to change your personal information, contains the help page, and allows you to log off. It is the main page of the system.

<h2>Sensor and User Management Module</h2>

An administrator can:  <br>
<b>Remove a sensor</b> by entering ID of a sensor in the sensor management module under "Remove a Sensor".<br>  
<b>Add a sensor</b> by entering the requested sensor information in the sensor management module under "Add a Sensor".  <br>
<b>Add a user</b> by entering the requested user information under "Add User" in the user management module.  <br>
<b>Remove a user</b> by entering the username of the user to be deleted under "Remove User" in the user management module.  <br>
<b>Update a user</b> by entering the username of the user and then filling in any fields that are to be changed and leaving the unchanged fields empty under "Update User in the user management module."  <br>
<b>Add a person</b> by entering the requested information under "Add Person" in the user management module. <br>  
<b>Remove a person</b> by entering the person ID of the person to be deleted under "Remove Person" in the user  management module.  <br>
<b>Update a person</b> by entering the person ID of the person to be updated and then filling in any fields that are to be changed and leaving unchanged fields empty under "Update Person" in the user management module.  <br>

<h2>Subscribe Module:</h2>

Scientists are able to subscribe and unsubscribe to sensors with this module. <br>
At the top, two tables are displayed; <br>
The first being <b>all the sensors</b>, and the second being <b>the sensors the current scientist is susbcribed to.</b><br>
To <b>add</b> a new sensor to your subscriptions type the <b>sensor id</b> of the sensor wanted underneath the heading <b>Add a Subscription</b> and click the button that says <b>Add Subscription.</b><br>
To <b>remove</b> a subscription type the <b>sensor id</b> of the sensor you want to remove underneath the heading <b>Remove a Subscription</b>, and press the button that says <b>Remove Subscription.</b> 

<h2>Uploading Module</h2>
A data curator can:  <br>
<b>Upload audio data</b> by filling in the requested information under "Audio Information" in the upload module, then selecting "choose file" at the bottom, and selecting a .wav file, then clicking upload.  <br>
<b>Upload image data</b> by filling in the requested information under "Image Information" in the upload module, then selecting "choose file" at the bottom, and selecting a .jpg or .jpeg file, the clicking upload.<br>  
<b>Upload scalar data</b> by simply clicking "choose file" and choosing a .csv file, then clicking upload.  
All data IDs are generated by the upload process.  <br>

<h2>Search Module</h2>
The search module allows you to search through the sensor information that you are subscribed to. It gives you the option to search by keywords, sensor type (which are <b>"i"</b> for image,<b> "a"</b> for audio, and <b>"s"</b> for scalar data), and a time range. <br>
Once the search is complete, you can view all the information that matches your specifications. If the type of sensor is an image, it will also display a thumbnail of the image.<br>
If you find sensor data that you would like to download, you can click the download link (or in the case of an image, click the thumbnail), which is located in the last column.<br>
You will be prompted to find a location to save the file, which you can then view on your local system. 


<h2>Data Analysis Module</h2>

Scientists are able to use this module to retrieve an analysis of the sensors they are currently subscribed to. <br>
There are two main parts to this module.
<h3>1.	Generalization</h3>
The generalization is obtained by entering a <b>Sensor ID</b> and clicking <b>Generalization(Roll Up)</b><br>
When you hit the submit button, it will give you the <b>Average, Maximum and Minimum</b> respectively starting at the smallest time of day, <br>
then going to weeks, all the way up to years. The last Avg., Max, and Min it will give you will be over all the scalar data for that sensor. <br>
<b>Note this will only work for scalar data, not images or audio.</b>
<h3>2.	Specialization</h3> 
The specialization is obtained by entering a <b>Sensor ID</b>. From here you can choose how small you want to specialize the data to. <br>
You start by selecting a <b>year</b>, and then a <b>quarter</b>, and so on, until you are at the time type you want. <br>
<b>Note that the times must decrease, and you cannot enter, for example, a day before entering a month. </b><br><br>
When you have the appropriate time level, click the <b>Specialization (Drill Down)</b> button.<br>
This will display the <b>Average, Maximum and Minimum</b> respectivaley of your chosen sensor's scalar data.
